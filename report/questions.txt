Hey <>

As part of my fyp i need to complete some user trials
I was wondering if you would be able to spare me 10 minutes to test it out and complete a questionnaire
The link is http://93.89.245.32:5000/
if you go to through the  walkthrough page it should tell you everything you need to know. 

if you could follow that and just send me back your answers to the questions that would be amazing.

Thanks
