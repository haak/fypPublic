QUESTIONS:

1. In round 1 and 4 there were no titles or posters did this affect your choosing of a movies? if yes how important on a scale of 1-5 would you say posters and titles are?
A:   Posters and titles are a 3/5 importance to me, in round 1 I had very little to go off of information wise so I chose at random until I got more information. If I had seen those posters/titles I would have either known the movie or judged more clearly if I would like it. In round 4, the ratings of the movies helped more than a title/poster could have however.

2. Did you notice anything different about the explanations in round 3 and 6 compared to other rounds.
A: (I’m gonna be honest, I forgot about those rounds after I finished, so I didn’t actually notice much except that not every movie said the same thing every round. For instance one movie might say what production company it is after I’ve vetoed a movie, but the next movie might say what genre it is as opposed to saying the production company.)

3. rounds 1,2,3 and rounds 4,5,6 had different movies. Did you notice a difference? was there a set that were better?
A: I did notice that the round 4,5 and 6 had better recommendations for my taste, there weren’t any comedies and more crime/horror films appeared. So I preferred the second set of movies

4. On a scale of 1-5 would you find a system like this helpful. 
A: 4, I tend to not go off of recommendation systems but this one was interesting to try out because I could explicitly say if I liked a movie or not.

5. On a scale of 1-5 did you find this more interesting than a normal recommender.
A: 5, way more interesting and much more attuned to me.

6. did you see any explanation types that were particularly interesting.
A: I noticed a lot of movies mention the English language which was an unusual thing to mention in my opinion, the mention of what production company it was, was very helpful as I could take a guess whether I would like it or not.

1. Sometimes, 5.
2. Yes, they were different. (Seemed to be more useful).
3. Not really, no. They both seemed random in choice of movies/explanations.
4. 2 its current form. "Like this system", with some refinement it could be a 4.
5. 4
6. "Based on a novel (insert novel name here)"

MLOC
1. in some ways, yes, but it mostly helped me recognize movies I know. I don't think it affected my choice between movies I hadn't seen before.
2. more features related to actors and producers; might have been more useful if I knew the actors, instead of choosing random ones

3. didn't really notice a difference
4. I'm bad with number ratings but yes, if I'd taken the time to input all the movies I'd seen. I haven't seen 150 movies, though. 4/5
5. was fun to play with, felt less opaque and more understandable than a traditional recommender (you'll like this cos you liked this); sense of agency when eliminating options was nice. 4/5
6. neighbour ratings were interesting (if I understood them right); probably hamstrung by the lack of users but I could see it being neat with more data

QUESTIONS:

1. In round 1 and 4 there were no titles or posters did this affect your choosing of a movies? if yes how important on a scale of 1-5 would you say posters and titles are?
A:   Yes, I found that posters were extremely important in my decision making. I would say that they were the primary factor even, followed by title and genre. I would rate the presence of poster and titles to be 5/5 in terms of importance. 

2. Did you notice anything different about the explanations in round 3 and 6 compared to other rounds.
A: Rounds 1 and 2 were based off of "movie attributes" like the runtime, genre, production house, etc whereas round 3 was based off of the cast, director, producer, etc. I think that was it.

3. rounds 1,2,3 and rounds 4,5,6 had different movies. Did you notice a difference? was there a set that were better?
A: The first set seemed to be more recent movies, which I personally preferred. This could have just been a coincidence too, not sure.

4. On a scale of 1-5 would you find a system like this helpful. 
A: It wasnt bad, gives a variet of movies based on your profile. So yeah, it is a bit helpful. But is it better than, say, IMDB giving movie recommendations without you having to go through the process of elimination? I wouldnt say so. The process, albeit simple, still requires time. Something that doesnt require time is always better than something that does.

5. On a scale of 1-5 did you find this more interesting than a normal recommender.
A: Interesting? Yes, it is interesting to me so I would rate it 3 or 4 in terms of interest.

6. did you see any explanation types that were particularly interesting.
A: The runtime was odd, but I can see that being useful. If someone prefers shorter movies, they are more likely to watch the shorter ones that are recommended.

2. Did you notice anything different about the explanations in round 3 and 6 compared to other rounds.
A: No

3. rounds 1,2,3 and rounds 4,5,6 had different movies. Did you notice a difference? was there a set that were better?

4. On a scale of 1-5 would you find a system like this helpful.

Victor
1) yeah, 5/5
2) yes, it focused more on who was involved in making the movie than the movie content
3) yeah, the first set felt more high energy, I preferred the second set
4) 4/5
5) 4/5
6) I liked seeing that a certain person directed or wrote the movie, and how many of their movies I would have rated highly, and I liked when the titles / posters were hidden since I chose something I probably would have thrown out straight away from the poster. I spent more time thinking if I might like to watch it

JULIA 
1. In round 1 and 4 there were no titles or posters did this affect your choosing of a movies? if yes how important on a scale of 1-5 would you say posters and titles are?
A: Yes, I would be more willing to watch a movie with an actor I recognize on the front.   

2. Did you notice anything different about the explanations in round 3 and 6 compared to other rounds.
A: No.

3. rounds 1,2,3 and rounds 4,5,6 had different movies. Did you notice a difference? was there a set that were better?
A: Yes, the same pool of options was given in round 1-3. Neighbour ratings instead or with descriptions were used. I prefer the initial descriptions, they give more of an idea on what the movie is about and allow me to form an opinion before I see the movie.

4. On a scale of 1-5 would you find a system like this helpful. 
A: Yes, often spend a lot of time deciding what to watch, and having something tell me what to watch would save time.

5. On a scale of 1-5 did you find this more interesting than a normal recommender.
A: Somewhat, since a smaller pool of choices is show, so easier to make a decision comapred to something like netflix, where at least 50 'recommended' options are shown

6. did you see any explanation types that were particularly interesting.
A: No.
